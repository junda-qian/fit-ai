## What to Present (5-10 minute demo)

### Hook (30 seconds):
"Imagine having a personal trainer and nutritionist in your pocket, but instead of paying $200/hour, it's powered by AI and costs $15/month"

### Problem (1 minute):
- Generic fitness apps give static plans
- Real coaches are expensive
- People plateau and don't know what to change
- Trial and error wastes months

### Solution - Live Demo (5-7 minutes):

**Act 1: Setup (1 min)**
- "Here's Sarah, trying to lose 20lbs"
- Show goal setting, initial measurements
- AI generates first meal plan and workout

**Act 2: Progress (2 min)**
- Fast-forward through 3 weeks of logging
- Show beautiful progress charts
- "Everything looks good, she's losing 1lb/week"

**Act 3: Plateau (2 min)**
- "Week 4-5: Weight stops moving"
- Click "Get AI Advice"
- Watch AI analyze data, detect plateau
- AI explains: "No weight change for 2 weeks despite 1800cal target"
- AI recommends: "Reduce to 1600 calories, here's updated meal plan"

**Act 4: Coordination (1 min)**
- "But she also wants to get stronger"
- Show training AI suggesting volume increase
- Show conflict: Cut calories vs add training?
- AI asks priority, Sarah chooses "strength for now"
- Watch AI coordinate: "Maintain calories, increase volume, reassess in 2 weeks"

**Act 5: Results (1 min)**
- Show resumed progress
- Show insights: "Best progress happens with 3x/week training"
- Show achievements unlocked

### Business Case (1 minute):
- Market size: $96B fitness industry
- Competitors: MyFitnessPal ($150M revenue), Noom ($400M revenue)
- Your edge: AI agents that actually adapt, not static formulas
- Revenue model: $15-25/month, target 1000 users = $180-300K/year

### Call to Action (30 seconds):
- "This is the next generation of fitness apps"
- "Currently in beta, launching Q1 2026"
- "Looking for beta testers" or "Open to investment/partnership"

## Risk Mitigation

### What could go wrong in demo:

**Risk 1: AI takes too long to respond**
- Mitigation: Pre-cache some AI responses
- Backup: Have video recording ready

**Risk 2: AWS costs spike during development**
- Mitigation: Set billing alerts at $50, $100
- Use Bedrock's cheapest model (Nova Lite) for development
- Monitor CloudWatch costs weekly

**Risk 3: AI gives bad advice**
- Mitigation: Add safety rails (max calorie cut = 500, min calories = 1200)
- Human review of AI outputs during testing
- Disclaimers: "Consult doctor before starting"

**Risk 4: Running out of time**
- Mitigation: This roadmap has buffer weeks
- Priority ranking: Weeks 1-2 (AI agents) are non-negotiable
- Week 7 features are optional/cuttable
